# SC2006 SignBridge

This is a mobile application designed for SC2006, developed using the Argon React Native Template. The application aims to provide a platform for real-time sign language translation using AI-powered computer vision techniques.

## 📌 Project Description
The SC2006 Sign Language App is designed to help bridge the communication gap between the hearing and non-hearing communities by recognizing sign language gestures and converting them into readable text or speech.

## 🔥 Features
- Real-time sign language detection and translation.
- User-friendly interface with React Native UI components (Argon React Native Template).
- Interactive feedback for detected signs.
- Multi-language support (if applicable).
